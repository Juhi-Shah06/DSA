// To extract the digits from a numbers , we have to perform to operations: modulus and division
// If we want the last digit of the number, do n%10
// If we do not want the last digit , n/10
// example: 7789 % 10 = 9
//          7789 / 10 = 778
// Eventually there will be a point where you will get 0.
// After the digits are extracted, we notice that it is in decreasing order.

// Psuedocode:
// int n
// while(n>0){
//     last_digit = n%10
//     n = n/10
// }

// Whenever the problem involves division, the time complexity will be algorithmic.
// Time complexity: O(log(base 10) n)

// Eucleadian Algorithm
// If we want to find gcd then:
// gcd(a,b) = gcd(greater_number % smaller_number)  until one of them is 0 and the other number is gcd.
// time complexity: O(log5 min(a,b))
